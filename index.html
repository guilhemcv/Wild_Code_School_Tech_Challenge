          <p>
            Dear Visitor,<br />
            Welcome to our kingdom, here is some history :<br /><br />
            Colchis, ancient region at the eastern end of the Black Sea south of
            the Caucasus, in the western part of modern Georgia. It consisted of
            the valley of the Phasis (modern Rioni) River. In Greek mythology,
            Colchis was the home of Medea and the destination of the Argonauts,
            a land of fabulous wealth and the domain of sorcery. Historically,
            Colchis was colonized by Milesian Greeks, to whom the native
            Colchians supplied gold, slaves, hides, linen cloth, agricultural
            produce, and such shipbuilding materials as timber, flax, pitch, and
            wax. The ethnic composition of the Colchians, who were described by
            Herodotus as black Egyptians, is unclear. After the 6th century BCE
            they lived under the nominal suzerainty of Achaemenian Persia,
            passed into the kingdom of Mithradates VI (1st century BCE), and
            then came under the rule of Rome.
